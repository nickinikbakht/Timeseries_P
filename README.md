1. **Understanding Time Series**  
   The first and essential step is to understand the structure, patterns, and behavior of time series data.  
   This includes trends, seasonality, noise, and stationarity.

   - In time series analysis, the changes between sequence points are very important.
   - A good starting point is to validate your sequence—especially if your dataset includes timestamps for each record.
   - Check for inconsistencies, missing intervals, or sudden shifts. These changes can indicate significant events or data quality issues.
   - Identifying such changes helps you better prepare your data for modeling and interpretation.

2. **Define Your Main Goal**  
   Before starting any time series analysis, clearly define what you want to achieve.  
   Are you trying to forecast future values, detect anomalies, or understand underlying patterns?  
   Having a specific goal will guide your choice of methods and models.
