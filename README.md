    <strong>Understanding Time Series</strong><br>
    The first and essential step is to understand the structure, patterns, and behavior of time series data. 
    This includes trends, seasonality, noise, and stationarity.<br><br>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        In time series analysis, the changes between sequence points are very important.
      </li>
      <li>
        A good starting point is to validate your sequence—especially if your dataset includes timestamps for each record.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check for inconsistencies, missing intervals, or sudden shifts. These changes can indicate significant events or data quality issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identifying such changes helps you better prepare your data for modeling and interpretation.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <li>
    <strong>Define Your Main Goal</strong><br>
    Before starting any time series analysis, clearly define what you want to achieve. 
    Are you trying to forecast future values, detect anomalies, or understand underlying patterns? 
    Having a specific goal will guide your choice of methods and models.
